        <p>
            Java is a programming language that was created by the British computer
            scientist Tony Brooker in the 1970s. It was designed to be used for
            writing video games. It is also one of the first programming languages

            wanted to create an easy-to-use language that would allow them to write
            programs without having to learn complicated assembly code.
